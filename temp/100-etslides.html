Du ThoughtWorks Technology Radar de mars 2012 :
ClojureScript illustrates just how cross-platform the
core of Clojure really is: they ported the primary parts
to run on JavaScript. It is missing some of the whizz-
bang features of Clojure on the JVM and CLR, like
software transactional memory, but has a surprisingly
high fidelity with its more sophisticated cousins. One
interesting option afforded by ClojureScript is the ability
to send data structures à la JSON using ClojureScript as
the data structure. Because Clojure is a Lisp, this means
that you can also send “real” code.

CLR, javascript, etc


Clojure supports the use of type hints to assist the compiler in avoiding reflection in performance-critical areas of code. Normally, one should avoid the use of type hints until there is a known performance bottleneck. Type hints are metadata tags placed on symbols or expressions that are consumed by the compiler. They can be placed on function parameters, let-bound names, var names (when defined), and expressions:

(defn len [x]
  (.length x))
 
(defn len2 [^String x]
  (.length x))
 
(time (reduce + (map len (repeat 1000000 "asdf"))))
; "Elapsed time: 3007.198 msecs"
; 4000000
user=> (time (reduce + (map len2 (repeat 1000000 "asdf"))))
"Elapsed time: 308.045 msecs"
4000000

Clojure solves the same problems that OO solves, but it solves them in different ways. Instead of encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance, you have closures, namespaces, pure functions, immutable data, and multimethods. Idiomatic OO gives you a bloated type system with duplicated code hidden away behind encapsulation boundaries and little hope for thread safety. Clojure offers a radical alternative: a lean type system, a rich function library, and language-level concurrency support that is usable by mere mortals.

There is a lot more to Clojure than we have covered here: lazy and infinite sequences, destructuring, macros, software transactional memory, agents, seamless Java interop, and more. But those are topics for another day.
