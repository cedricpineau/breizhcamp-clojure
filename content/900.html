"Clojure solves the same problems that OO solves, but it solves them in different ways.<br><br>
Instead of encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance, you have closures, namespaces, pure functions, immutable data, and multimethods.<br><br>
Idiomatic OO gives you a bloated type system with duplicated code hidden away behind encapsulation boundaries and little hope for thread safety.<br><br>
Clojure offers a radical alternative: a lean type system, a rich function library, and language-level concurrency support that is usable by mere mortals."
